# 10 Games Challenge

This is a learning project where I create 10 games using the Monogame framework. The purpose of this exercise is to develop games from the ground up without following any step-by-step tutorials so I can develop solid foundational skills in game programming.

## List of Games
1. Pong
2. Breakout (currently developing)

Inspired from the 20 game challenge:
